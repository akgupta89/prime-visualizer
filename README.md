# Prime Visualizer

A modern, interactive visualization of prime numbers arranged in a spiral pattern. This application allows you to explore the fascinating patterns that emerge when prime numbers are visualized in a spiral arrangement.

This has been rebuilt from 2D to a modern 3D view with AI.

## Live Demo

Visit the live demo at [https://akgupta89.github.io/prime-visualizer](https://akgupta89.github.io/prime-visualizer)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Mathematical Background

The visualization is based on the concept of the Ulam spiral (named after Stanisław Ulam), which is a graphical depiction of prime numbers. It was discovered in 1963 and shows surprising patterns in the distribution of primes.

This application uses a polar variant where numbers are arranged in a spiral based on their square root, with the angle between consecutive numbers adjustable by the user.

## Deployment

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

```
npm run deploy
```
